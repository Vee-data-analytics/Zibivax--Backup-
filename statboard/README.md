# Django Application with Dash Scripts and Inventory Management

This Django application combines the power of Django for user management, data storage, and Django Dash for interactive data visualization. It also features inventory management for electrical meters.

## Dash Scripts

### app1.py
This Dash app displays employee data in a Dash DataTable. It loads data from a Django model (likely the Employee model) and displays it in a table. Users can edit and delete rows, and there are options to add columns and export the data to Excel.

### app3.py
This app is for displaying and processing data. It has a callback for processing data using a function called `process_uploaded_files`. The processed data is displayed in a Dash DataTable. Users can click a button to initiate data processing.

### app4.py
This script appears to be related to data preprocessing. It includes functions for encoding detection, cleaning, and training machine learning models using `RandomForestClassifier`.

## Models

### models.py
- **Tasks**: Handles task management, including fields for task type, status, and relevant details.
- **Normalizations**: Used for normalizing data.

## Inventory Management

Inventory management is crucial for tracking and managing electrical meters in a warehouse. Below are some key points to consider for implementing inventory management in your application:

1. **Define an Inventory Model**: Create a Django model, such as `InventoryItem`, to represent items in your warehouse. This model may include fields like the item name, quantity, location, and additional details relevant to electrical meters.

2. **Record Incoming Items**: When new electrical meters are received in your warehouse, create records for these items in the `InventoryItem` model. Ensure that you update the quantity field accordingly.

3. **Record Outgoing Items**: When electrical meters are dispatched or allocated to specific tasks, update the quantity of these items in the inventory. Maintain a log of these transactions, including the date and recipient details.

4. **Stock Alerts**: Implement alerts or notifications for low stock levels. This can help you restock items in a timely manner to avoid shortages.

5. **Batch and Serial Numbers**: If your meters have batch or serial numbers, capture and store this information in the inventory records. This can be helpful for traceability.

6. **Location Tracking**: If your warehouse has different storage locations, record the location of each item in the inventory. This helps in easy retrieval.

7. **Integration with Tasks**: Link your task management system with inventory. When tasks are assigned to employees for meter installations or replacements, ensure that inventory is updated to reflect these allocations.

8. **Barcode Scanning**: Implement barcode scanning for efficient data entry and retrieval of items in the inventory. Barcode scanning can significantly speed up inventory management tasks.

9. **Data Analysis**: Use Dash apps to create data visualizations and reports for inventory management. You can track the movement of items over time, analyze usage patterns, and plan for restocking.

10. **Access Control**: Implement access controls to restrict who can add, modify, or delete inventory records. Only authorized personnel should have access to these features.

11. **Integration with Supplier Information**: If applicable, integrate your inventory system with supplier information. This can help in reordering items when stock is low.

12. **Audit Trails**: Maintain an audit trail of all inventory-related activities, including who made changes and when. This adds accountability and transparency to the process.

13. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular physical audits of your inventory to ensure that the records match the actual stock. Any discrepancies should be investigated and resolved.

14. **Export and Reporting**: Allow users to export inventory data and generate reports. This can include stock levels, transaction history, and more.

15. **Inventory Management Dashboard**: Create a dashboard within your Django application using Dash to provide an overview of the current inventory status, recent transactions, and alerts.

By incorporating these features and best practices into your Django application, you can effectively manage the inventory of electrical meters in your warehouse. This ensures that you have the right meters available when needed and that your tasks are accurately reflected in the stock levels.
